This project includes implementations of several machine-learning algorithms with the goal of detecting if a given word is a metaphor or not.

* The strongest performing model is found in run_test.py and run_train.py, being SVM with the implemented split algorithm
* Other tested algorithms are found in the Extra Models folder
* Information for analyzing the training data and gathered results are found in images and DataAnalysis.py
